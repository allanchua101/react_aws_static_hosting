### Demo Application

![Home Page](https://github.com/allanchua101/react_aws_static_hosting/blob/main/assets/website-home.png)

Our demo application is a React web app designed for providing a means of searching movies so that you don't get subjected to Advertisements and various IP trackers.

### Build Deployment

![Build Process](https://github.com/allanchua101/react_aws_static_hosting/blob/main/assets/build_process.png)

You could build the React web app and deploy it to the main and failover S3 bucket by running the following command:

```sh
AWS_PROFILE="foo-profile" \
  ENV_NAME="dev" \
  PROJECT_NAME="movie-search" \
  MAIN_DISTRIBUTION_ID="YOUR_CF_DISTRIBUTION_ID_HERE" \
  ./003_build.sh
```
