### Design Advantages

- Static asset caching
- SSL and HTTPS support
- Less effort required for managing and operating static site infrastructure.
- Lower cost of static asset distribution compared to VM and container based architectures.
- Free public SSL certificate from AWS certificate manager.
- Higher tolerance against surge of requests thanks to CloudFront traffic distribution across pops
- Repeatable, reliable and scalable provisioning process thanks to Terraform and Terraform environment-specific variable files.
- Optional static IP whitelisting for back office-related portals
- Tolerance against single region failures
- Security headers are applied on CloudFront responses using [CloudFront security header policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-response-headers-policies.html)
- Prevent caching of `index.html` files which often results to referencing of obsolete js and css assets for React and Vue apps.

### Demo Application

![Home Page](https://github.com/allanchua101/react_aws_static_hosting/blob/main/assets/website-home.png)

Our demo application is a React web app designed for providing a means of searching movies so that you don't get subjected to Advertisements and various IP trackers.

### Local Build and Deploy Process

![Build Process](https://github.com/allanchua101/react_aws_static_hosting/blob/main/assets/build_process.png)

The diagram above depicts the process involved in running semi-automated deployments from a developer's machine. This process could be broken into four various parts:

1. Build React WebApp -> This stage is used for compiling the React web application so that we could produce static assets that could be deployed to our AWS-based static website hosting infrastructure.
2. Upload to main S3 -> This stage is used for deploying (Uploading) the build artifacts produced on stage 1 into the our main S3 bucket.
3. Upload to failover S3 -> This stage is used for deploying (Uploading) the build artifacts produced on stage 1 into our failover S3 bucket.
4. Flush Cached files inside CloudFront edge servers -> This stage is used for flushing the cached files inside CloudFront servers which ensures elimination of static assets from old builds.

You could build the React web app and deploy it to the main and failover S3 bucket by running the following command:

```sh
cd ./scripts

AWS_PROFILE="foo-profile" \
  ENV_NAME="dev" \
  PROJECT_NAME="movie-search" \
  MAIN_DISTRIBUTION_ID="YOUR_CF_DISTRIBUTION_ID_HERE" \
  ./003_build.sh
```

## FAQs

- How to disable WAF on this template? -> WAF could easily be disabled by removing the files associated to WAF (`waf_ipset.tf`, `waf_rule_group.tf`, `waf_web_acl.tf`) and removing line #8 on `cloudfront.tf` file that associates the WAF with the projects CloudFront distribution.
